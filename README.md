# nonogram

A Nonogram solver and generator for Dart and Flutter.

Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. 

As the package is still highly experimental, 0.0.x versioning is used.
